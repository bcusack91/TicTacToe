#Portfolio Project

Title of the project: MIT Portfolio Project

Description of the project: In this project, I created a landing page where people can see more information about me. Using bootstrap, I added a navbar, which has a tab for a projects page. On the projects page, prospective employers can see some of the work I completed in this class

Roadmap of future improvements: This website could benefit from a bug fix which does not allow the user to click over a previously clicked square to change it from an x to an o.  Furthermore, this website would benefit from some cool sound effects when the user clicks or cool animation effects when a user wins.
